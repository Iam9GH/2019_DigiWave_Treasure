# 2019 DigiWave
Shell is a Unity project made for a live performance in Digiwave at Kaohsiung Music Center, 11th Oct 2019.
The project contains a complete 10-minute visual for each of the two songs. Those two songs have very different styles. The visual of the first track focus on the deconstruction of the shells, while the second explores the connection between whales and the ocean.

The music is produced by well-known music producer Lim Giong.
